1. 3 will be printed as its the length of the array
2. 150, discounted price is 300 * 0.5
3. 150, Math.round(300 * 0.5 * 100)/100
4. (3) [50, 100, 150], the original array
5. Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined, because its using let, which is not in the scope
6. Uncaught ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined, using let again which is out the scope
7. 150, same math as number 3
8. (3) [50, 100, 150]
9. Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined, its using let which is out of scope
10. 3, length of prices
11. (3) [50, 100, 150]

+ ‘2’ > 1 Output: true
+ ‘2’ < ‘12’ Output: false
+ 2 == ‘2’ Output: true
+ 2 === ‘2’ Output: false
+ true == 2 Output: false
+ true === Boolean(2) Output: true

15.  == used when comparing without data types, === will check data types when comparing
